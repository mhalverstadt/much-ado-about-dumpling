## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Sample landing page for potential freeland clients built with html and css and a bit of javascript. 

## Optimizations
I know that the images are too large and would like to scale them down to improve loading times. Also needs to be optimized for mobile, although it is reponsive and re-sizes depending on screensize. 

## Lessons Learned:
Leaning about the dev tools and Lighthouse to improve performance.
